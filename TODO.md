##Â TODO

* Add environment with `pylint`, `pytest`, &c.
* Set up imports properly so I don't have to run it in module mode.
* Run scripts for days?
* Revisit Day 5?
* Tidy up day 7.
* Add proper type hints.
* Tidy up day 10.
* Find a better solution for day 12. See notes.
* Find a neater way to move the boxes for day 15.
* Write a more efficient implementation of dijkstra's algorithm in utils.algorithms.    
* (Will never do) Try to find a solution for day 17 that works for all inputs. Might not even be possible -- how expressive is the language?
* Day 18 solution is boring and slow. Think of something better.
* Find and resolve off-by-one-error in day 20.
